# Loan Approval Classification
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, LoanApprovalClassificationusingML.ipynb, for analyzing loan approval data. The notebook answers several questions related to loan applications and develops a simple predictive model to determine loan approval.
## Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is loandata.json, which is located in the **Data** directory. It includes various features about loan applicants and their approval status.
## Tasks
All the tasks are mentioned in **Questions.docx** file.
1. **Percentage of Total Applicants for Each Unique Value of Dependents**

   Calculate the percentage of total applicants for each unique value of the Dependents feature.

2. **Percentage of Applications Approved for Self-Employed Applicants**

   Determine the percentage of loan applications approved for self-employed applicants.

3. **Percentage of Rejections for Married Male Applicants**

   Calculate the percentage of loan rejections for married male applicants

   4. **Property Area with the Maximum Approval Ratio**
     
   Identify which Property_Area has the highest loan approval ratio.

5. **Average Number of Dependents per Income Group**

   Compute the average number of dependents for different income groups.

# 6. Approval Ratio for Various Combinations of Property_Area and Marital Status
Find the approval ratio for the following combinations of Property_Area and Marital Status:

- Rural, Married
- Rural, Unmarried
- Urban, Married
- Urban, Unmarried
# 7. Predictive Model for Loan Approval
A logistic regression model has been created to predict loan approval. The model achieved an accuracy score of 88%.
# Instructions
1. Download the loandata.json file located in the data directory.
2. Open LoanApprovalClassificationusingML.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and model training.
