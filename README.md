# Loan Approval Classification
# Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, LoanApprovalClassificationusingML.ipynb, for analyzing loan approval data. The notebook answers several questions related to loan applications and develops a simple predictive model to determine loan approval.
# Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is loandata.json, which is located in the **Data** directory. It includes various features about loan applicants and their approval status.
# Tasks
All the tasks are 
**1. Percentage of Total Applicants for Each Unique Value of Dependents**
Calculate the percentage of total applicants for each unique value of the Dependents feature.

# 2. Percentage of Applications Approved for Self-Employed Applicants
Determine the percentage of loan applications approved for self-employed applicants.

# 3. Percentage of Rejections for Married Male Applicants
Calculate the percentage of loan rejections for married male applicants.

# 4. Property Area with the Maximum Approval Ratio
Identify which Property_Area has the highest loan approval ratio.

# 5. Average Number of Dependents per Income Group
Compute the average number of dependents for different income groups.

6. Approval Ratio for Various Combinations of Property_Area and Marital Status
Find the approval ratio for the following combinations of Property_Area and Marital Status:

Rural, Married
Rural, Unmarried
Urban, Married
Urban, Unmarried
7. Predictive Model for Loan Approval
